# MiTio Project - Index
---
## Explanation:
I am MiTio, the creator of the YouTube channel "MiTio".  Here I will be posting my progress on certain videos, which will give everyone interested a sneak peak or possibly a early-acess version of my next video. 

The notes taken here will be: scripts, planning, ideas or just random notes. Some of the things here might be ddifficult to understand, *because these are meant for myself.* I'll be quite happy if someone gets inspired from my thinking process and if you have ideas on how to improve myself, write in my YouTube comment section.

## Get Started (Updated On New Video)
