# MiTio Project - Index
---
## Explanation:
I am Mitko (formally known as Dimitar), the creator of the YouTube channel "MiTio".  Here I will be posting my progress on certain videos, which will give everyone interested a sneak peak or possibly a early-acess version of my next video. 

Im practising my note taking here so some notes may be in my native language, so start studying bulgarian, nerds

The notes taken here will be: scripts, planning, ideas or just random notes. Some of the things here might be ddifficult to understand, *because these are meant for myself.* I'll be quite happy if someone gets inspired from my thinking process and if you have ideas on how to improve myself, write in my YouTube comment section.
