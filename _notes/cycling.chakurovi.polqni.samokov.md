## Main Idea
 My mains idea for this video is cycling trough the forest to the [Chakurovi Polqni](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%D0%A7%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%8A%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8+%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8F%D0%BD%D0%B8/@42.2874104,23.5352466,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x14ab23631053934b:0x5d17c6b1e5540fde!8m2!3d42.2869613!4d23.5378808) (location attached to the hyperlink). The journey there will be with 2 asociates of mine.
1. Part 1 :
	- Intro / Start of video
	- Script : 3 of us gather (post proces we add +1 recruit) ;  kind of chaotic; Introduces everyone (btw one of them has yt channel ;) )
	- Shots: People apearing; +1 recruit; getting to the start of the forest trail
2. Part 2:
	- we get onto the track. Cycling will be boring for some poeple, so to make it interesting there are going to be quite a few cuts. 1 minute passes. Background noise starts to fade away, as the picture blurrs slowly - 'que in narrator' who starts talking :
3. Part 3: Narration (script):
4. Part 4: get to the field from the title - some shots of us doing random stuff - laugh here laugh there transition into closing and end into a video (gonna update this one l8er this day)

## Script (part 3):
